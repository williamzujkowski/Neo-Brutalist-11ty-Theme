```

**Format**: `type(scope): description`

**Types**: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `perf`, `chore`

### JavaScript Standards

**Required**:

- ES6+ features (classes, arrow functions, const/let)
- Single quotes for strings
- Semicolons always required
- 2-space indentation
- Max line length: 100 characters
- Proper error handling with try/catch
- Input validation and sanitization

**Example**:

```javascript

export class ComponentManager {
  constructor(options = {}) {
    this.options = { ...this.defaultOptions, ...options };
  }

  async initialize() {
    try {
      await this.loadResources();
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Initialization failed:', error);
      throw error;
    }
  }
}

// ‚ùå INCORRECT
function componentManager(options) {
  var self = this;
  self.options = options || {};
}
```

### CSS Standards

**Required**:

- BEM naming convention
- CSS custom properties for theming
- Component-based organization

**Example**:

```css

  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  padding: 2rem;
  background: var(--color-primary);
}

.hero-section__title {
  font-size: 2.5rem;
  color: var(--color-text);
}

.hero-section__title--large {

  <h1 id="hero-title" class="hero-section__title">
    {{ title | escapeHTML }}
  </h1>
  {% if subtitle %}
    <p class="hero-section__subtitle">
      {{ subtitle | escapeHTML }}
    </p>
