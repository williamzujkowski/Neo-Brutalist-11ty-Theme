Of course. Here is a comprehensive project plan designed to be executed by
`claude-flow`. This plan outlines a systematic approach to analyze, refactor,
secure, and enhance the quality of the provided repository.

### Project Plan: Repository Modernization & Quality Enhancement

**Project Goal:** To transform the repository into a high-quality, secure,
well-organized, and maintainable project by leveraging a multi-agent swarm. The
process will follow best practices in code quality, security, testing, and
documentation.

---

### **Phase 1: Comprehensive Analysis & Organization**

**Goal:** To gain a complete understanding of the current codebase, identify
redundancies and vestigial files, and design a more logical and maintainable
repository structure.

1.  **Analyze Existing Structure:**
    - **Description:** A `researcher` agent will perform a deep analysis of the
      entire repository. This includes mapping the relationships between the
      `.claude` agent/command system, the `src` 11ty website, and the `tests`
      directory. The agent will identify duplicated functionality, especially
      within the numerous agent/command definitions and the seemingly
      overlapping test files (e.g., `comprehensive-links.spec.js`,
      `comprehensive-test.spec.js`, `mobile-comprehensive.spec.js`).
    - **Deliverables:**
      - A detailed report (`docs/ANALYSIS_REPORT.md`) outlining the current
        architecture.
      - A list of redundant or vestigial files and agents.
      - A dependency graph showing how different parts of the repo interact.

2.  **Define a New Repository Architecture:**
    - **Description:** An `architect` agent will design a new, logical directory
      structure that clearly separates the AI agent system from the web
      application it manages. The plan should propose a clear, intuitive
      structure and naming convention for all files and directories.
    - **Deliverables:**
      - A new proposed directory structure documented in
        `docs/NEW_ARCHITECTURE.md`.
      - Rationale for the new structure, focusing on maintainability and
        separation of concerns.

3.  **Create a File Migration Plan:**
    - **Description:** A `planner` agent will create a step-by-step plan for
      migrating files from the old structure to the new one. This plan will
      include a checklist of all file movements, renames, and necessary path
      updates in the code.
    - **Deliverables:**
      - A detailed migration checklist in `docs/MIGRATION_PLAN.md`.

---

### **Phase 2: Security & Dependency Modernization**

**Goal:** To identify and remediate security vulnerabilities, update outdated
dependencies, and establish a secure baseline for the project.

1.  **Conduct a Dependency Audit:**
    - **Description:** A `security-manager` agent will use `npm audit` and other
      static analysis tools to scan `package.json` for known vulnerabilities in
      dependencies.
    - **Deliverables:**
      - A vulnerability report (`docs/DEPENDENCY_VULNERABILITIES.md`).
      - A list of packages that require updates.

2.  **Update and Secure Dependencies:**
    - **Description:** A `coder` agent will update all outdated or vulnerable
      npm packages to the latest secure versions, resolving any compatibility
      issues that arise.
    - **Deliverables:**
      - An updated `package.json` and `package-lock.json`.
      - A summary of changes and resolved vulnerabilities.

3.  **Perform Static Code Analysis (SAST):**
    - **Description:** A `security-manager` agent will scan the JavaScript and
      configuration files for common security flaws, such as insecure
      configurations or potential injection points.
    - **Deliverables:**
      - A SAST report (`docs/SAST_REPORT.md`) detailing any findings.

---

### **Phase 3: Code Refactoring & Best Practices Implementation**

**Goal:** To improve code quality, consistency, and maintainability across the
entire repository.

1.  **Refactor and Consolidate AI Agents & Commands:**
    - **Description:** A `repo-architect` agent will review all files in
      `.claude/agents` and `.claude/commands`. It will consolidate duplicated
      logic, standardize the frontmatter/markdown structure, remove placeholder
      files, and organize them into a more logical hierarchy under the new
      architecture.
    - **Deliverables:**
      - A refactored set of agent and command definition files.
      - A new, clear organizational structure for the AI system.

2.  **Refactor Website Source Code (`src`):**
    - **Description:** A `coder` agent specializing in frontend technologies
      will refactor the Nunjucks templates, CSS, and JavaScript in the `src`
      directory. The focus will be on modularity, use of CSS custom properties,
      and modern JavaScript practices. The `CLEANUP-REPORT.md` will be used as a
      starting point.
    - **Deliverables:**
      - Improved and modularized `.njk`, `.css`, and `.js` files.
      - A `README.md` in the `src` directory explaining the frontend
        architecture.

3.  **Refactor and Consolidate Test Suite (`tests`):**
    - **Description:** A `tester` agent will refactor the Playwright test suite.
      It will consolidate the overlapping "comprehensive" test files into a
      single, cohesive suite, remove redundant tests, and improve the overall
      structure for better maintainability.
    - **Deliverables:**
      - A reorganized and streamlined `tests` directory.
      - A single, comprehensive test suite that is easier to run and maintain.

4.  **Establish and Enforce Code Style:**
    - **Description:** A `reviewer` agent will introduce and configure Prettier
      and ESLint to enforce a consistent code style across all JavaScript, JSON,
      and Markdown files. It will then reformat the entire codebase to match the
      new standard.
    - **Deliverables:**
      - Configuration files (`.prettierrc`, `.eslintrc.js`).
      - An `npm` script in `package.json` to run formatting and linting.
      - A codebase formatted to the new standard.

---

### **Phase 4: Comprehensive Testing & Validation**

**Goal:** To ensure that all changes are validated, the application is fully
functional, and quality has demonstrably improved.

1.  **Execute Full Regression Test Suite:**
    - **Description:** A `tester` agent will execute the entire refactored
      Playwright test suite against the modernized codebase to catch any
      regressions introduced during the refactoring phases.
    - **Deliverables:**
      - A full test report (`docs/REGRESSION_TEST_REPORT.md`).
      - Any necessary bug fixes to ensure all tests pass.

2.  **Validate `claude-flow` System Functionality:**
    - **Description:** An `orchestrator` agent will run a series of test prompts
      against the refactored `.claude` agent system to ensure that all agents,
      commands, and workflows function as expected after the overhaul.
    - **Deliverables:**
      - A validation report (`docs/AGENT_SYSTEM_VALIDATION.md`) confirming the
        AI system's operational status.

---

### **Phase 5: Documentation & Finalization**

**Goal:** To produce a high-quality, well-documented final product that is easy
for new developers to understand and contribute to.

1.  **Update Project Documentation:**
    - **Description:** A `documenter` agent will update the root `README.md`,
      `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and `TESTING.md` files to reflect the new repository
      structure, development workflow, and quality standards.
    - **Deliverables:**
      - Updated, comprehensive project documentation files.

2.  **Generate AI System Documentation:**
    - **Description:** The `documenter` agent will generate a new set of
      documentation for the `.claude` agent system, explaining the purpose of
      each agent, its capabilities, and how they coordinate.
    - **Deliverables:**
      - A new `README.md` within the refactored agent system directory.

3.  **Final Cleanup:**
    - **Description:** A `coordinator` agent will perform a final sweep to
      remove all old report files (`docs/CLEANUP-REPORT.md`, etc.), temporary
      files, and any other artifacts from the refactoring process.
    - **Deliverables:**
      - A clean repository containing only final, production-ready code and
        documentatio
