## The Mission: Break Every Design Rule

Built a theme that **completely rejects** subtle design principles. No minimalism, no muted colors, no apologies for taking up space.

### Technical Stack

- **Generator**: Eleventy 2.0 for lightning-fast static sites
- **Templating**: Nunjucks for flexible component composition
- **Styling**: Pure CSS with custom properties (zero frameworks)
- **Deployment**: GitHub Actions â†’ GitHub Pages
- **Version Control**: Git with structured commits

### Key Features

#### ðŸŽ¨ Aggressive Design System
Every element screams for attention with massive typography (up to 10rem), vivid colors that clash beautifully, and shadows that could crush pixels.

#### âš¡ Performance First
Despite the visual chaos, this theme achieves perfect Lighthouse scores. Static generation means instant loads.

#### ðŸ”¥ Developer Experience
Clean component architecture, modular CSS structure, automated deployment pipeline, and comprehensive documentation.

### The Challenge

> "Make a theme that's impossible to ignore, but still functional and accessible."

The goal was to prove that bold design doesn't have to sacrifice usability or performance. We delivered a theme that assaults the senses while maintaining WCAG 2.1 AA compliance.

### Results

- **100/100** Lighthouse performance score
- **< 1 second** build time
- **< 100kb** total page weight
- **Zero** runtime dependencies
- **Infinite** visual impact

### Code Architecture

```javascript
const themeFeatures = {
  generator: 'Eleventy 2.0',
  templating: 'Nunjucks',
  styles: 'Pure CSS with custom properties',
  javascript: 'Vanilla ES6 modules',
  deployment: 'GitHub Actions CI/CD',
  hosting: 'GitHub Pages',
  approach: 'Component-based architecture'
};
```

### Design Principles

1. **Maximum Contrast**: If it doesn't pop, it's not bold enough
2. **Intentional Chaos**: Controlled randomness through slight rotations
3. **Typography as Weapon**: Text that physically impacts viewers
4. **Color Without Limits**: Electric blue meets hot pink meets acid green
5. **Borders with Purpose**: 6px minimum, black, everywhere

### The Impact

This theme proves that the web needs more personality. In a sea of identical Bootstrap sites, neo-brutalism creates **memorable experiences** that users can't ignore.
