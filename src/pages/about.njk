                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My philosophy is simple: <strong>DESIGN SHOULD DISTURB THE COMFORTABLE</strong>. While others whisper in pastels, I roar in electric blues and acid greens. Where they suggest with subtle hints, I DECLARE with typography that could break windows.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Neo-Brutalism isn't just an aesthetic choice‚Äîit's a <em>STATEMENT OF INTENT</em>. It says: "I refuse to disappear into the background noise of safe, sanitized digital experiences." Every pixel is placed with PURPOSE. Every color chosen for MAXIMUM IMPACT.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This isn't chaos for chaos's sake. It's <strong>CONTROLLED REBELLION</strong>‚Äîbrutal honesty wrapped in uncompromising design that serves both form AND function.
