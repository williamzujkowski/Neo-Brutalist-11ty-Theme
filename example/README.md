# Neo-Brutalist Theme Example Site

This directory contains a minimal example site demonstrating how to use the
Neo-Brutalist 11ty Theme in your own projects.

## Quick Start

```bash
cd example/
npm install
npm run dev
```

This will start a development server showing the theme in action.

## Structure

- `package.json` - Dependencies and scripts
- `.eleventy.js` - Configuration extending the theme
- `src/` - Your content (uses theme templates and styles)

## Customization

The theme provides:

- Templates in `src/_includes/`
- Styles in `src/assets/css/`
- Scripts in `src/assets/js/`
- Data files in `src/_data/`

Override any of these by creating files with the same paths in your project.

## Building Your Site

1. Copy this example structure
2. Modify `src/index.md` and add your content
3. Customize colors and fonts in your CSS
4. Run `npm run build` for production

See the main README.md for full documentation.
